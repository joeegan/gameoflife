This pattern database contains 3280 pattern files for several hundred patterns in Conway's Game of Life and related cellular automata. All patterns are provided in the RLE file format, and most patterns are provided in multiple other file formats as well. The file formats are:

RLE (.rle): A short way on encoding patterns, but not very human-readable. See www.conwaylife.com/wiki/RLE
Plaintext (.cells): A human-readable, but not very efficient, file format that is primarily useful for small patterns. Dead cells are stored as "." and live cells are stored as "O". See www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Plaintext
Life 1.05 (.lif): A format that is very similar to plaintext, but makes some adjustments that allows it to store large patterns more efficiently. See www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Life_1.05
Life 1.06 (.lif): Stores patterns as a list of (x,y) coordinates of alive cells. See www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Life_1.06
